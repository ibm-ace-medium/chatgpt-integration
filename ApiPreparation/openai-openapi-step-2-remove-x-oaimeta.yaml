            The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

            Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

          nullable: true
          description: &completions_best_of_description |
            Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

            When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

            **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

          nullable: true
          description: &completions_frequency_penalty_description |
            Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

            type: integer
          description: &completions_logit_bias_description |
            Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

            Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
        logprobs: &completions_logprobs_configuration
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 5
          default: null
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_logprobs_description |
            Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

            The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.
        max_tokens:
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          default: 16
          example: 16
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_max_tokens_description |
            The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the completion.

            The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.
        n:
          type: integer
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 128
          default: 1
          example: 1
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_completions_description |
            How many completions to generate for each prompt.

            **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.
        presence_penalty:
          type: number
          default: 0
          minimum: -2
          maximum: 2
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_presence_penalty_description |
            Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

            [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)
        seed: &completions_seed_param

          nullable: true
          description: |
            If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.

            Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
        stop:
          description: &completions_stop_description >

          nullable: true
          description: &completions_temperature_description |
            What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

            We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
        top_p:
          type: number
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 1
          default: 1
          example: 1
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_top_p_description |
            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

            We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.

            Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

            **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.
            `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.
            `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.
            Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.

            `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.
